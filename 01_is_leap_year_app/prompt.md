# ChatGPT Prompt to generate is_leap_year_app.py

Write a function is_leap_year(year) that takes a year as an input and returns whether it's a leap year or not.

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for century years (ending in 00), which must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

The function should return "Leap" if the input year is a leap year, and "Not leap" otherwise.

Make sure to include a docstring for the function and comment your code to explain how it works.
